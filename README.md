This is an app I'm working on to practice with JS & AJAX. It's a simple To Do app that keeps things as a Single Page Application (SPA).

Future modifications will be to work on the page design (Bootstrap), add more details to the tasks (possibly a date entered, date due and a completion status rating). Some advanced features can be an automated reminder notification when a task is stagnant for a certain amount of time or when it's close to being due.

Enjoy!
